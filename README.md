Time Fries

Because “Time Fries” when you’re having fun. 

When planning a potluck, however, it is hard to have fun if you’re working against the clock or having difficulty coordinating with others on the spread. Time Fries aims to alleviate these issues, saving time and minimizing all that usually goes wrong in coordinating a spread.

Some examples of common issues are when people forget to pick up what they’re bringing, tell you they’re running late at the last minute, change what they’re bringing at the last minute, forget when/where the gathering is happening or if there’s a theme, etc. Time Fries aims to be a one-stop shop for all that goes into organizing these kinds of gatherings, with ways to avoid the aforementioned problems. You can send and receive invites via text message, enable sign-ups for food/other contributions, set up reminders with pre-determined reply options, and see all relevant information (like sign-up commitments, RSVPs, invite info, etc.) in one place.

Maybe you’re thinking, “This is overkill, it’s just a potluck/dinner party/gathering”. It’s true, some combination of an Evite, a shared spreadsheet, a group chat, and a naggy friend can accomplish what Time Fries does. However, Time Fries is different in that it ensures all information can be found in one place in an organized manner, contributions can be coordinated but not modified last minute, and people can be reminded of important info/to-dos while also responding to them easily via pre-determined reply options. Nobody feels bad clicking “not yet” when a robot asks if they have picked up the dessert the morning of the gathering.
